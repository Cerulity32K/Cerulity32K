# About Me
My name is Ethan Barry. I am a software engineering student based in Canada. I enjoy programming and biking in my free time
# What I Do
I experiment with a multitude of languages and designs. Sometimes, they turn into full projects.
# Goals
My goals are to learn and teach as much as possible, and to bring as much to the FOSS community as I can. Whether that be through contributions to large or small repositories or libraries/utilities I make/start myself, I hope to provide as much as possible.

# Achievements
FRC 2022-2023: Our team won the Provincial Championship and was invited to the World Championships. I designed and created an app to streamline data entry to form better alliances. I also designed a much more developer-ergonomic, interface-based system for autonomous code, as opposed to autonomous based on switch statement sequences.
