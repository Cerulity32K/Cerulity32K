# About Me
My name is Kali Barry. I am a software engineering student based in Canada. I enjoy programming and music in my free time.

# What I Do
I experiment with a multitude of languages and designs. Sometimes, they turn into full projects. In my school's FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) team, I help design sofware for the robot and other things, and I also bringing new ideas to the table.

# Skills
I am proficient in:
- Rust
- C#
- Python
- C++
- C

Intermediate in:
- CUDA
- Dart/Flutter
- Java

and familiar with:
- Lua
- TypeScript
- Julia
- MySQL
- Kotlin

I have great logical and analytical skills and can figure out and solve problems when working on any sort of software project.\
I am empathetic, understanding, collaborative and fun to work with.\
I can tutor others and teach them how to improve their skills, while also building confidence in their abilities.

# Goals
My goals are to learn and teach as much as possible, and to bring as much to the FOSS community as I can. Whether that be through contributions to large or small repositories or libraries/utilities I make/start myself, I hope to provide as much as possible. I also hope to one day be able to help secure systems at government level.

# Achievements
FRC 2022-2023 (Charged Up): Our team (2200) won the Provincial Championship and was invited to the World Championship. Unfortunately, this was unanticipated and we did not have enough time to schedule transportation. However, I designed and created an app in Xamarin (C#) to streamline data entry to form better alliances. I also designed a much more developer-ergonomic, interface-based system for autonomous code, as opposed to autonomous based on switch statement sequences.

FRC 2023-2024 (Crescendo): Our team qualified for the World Championship, and this year we were able to go. I rewrote my scouting app in Flutter (Dart), and adapted it to this year's game. This made the app much more responsive, and extra functionality was added to ensure that it was user-friendly. For example, in the start of the match, the starting location of the robot and locations of picked up game pieces is mimicked visually inside the app. The app was also improved visually compared to the 2022-2023 version of the app.
