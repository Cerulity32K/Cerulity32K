# About Me
My name is Ethan Barry. I am a software engineering student based in Canada. I enjoy programming and biking in my free time.

# What I Do
I experiment with a multitude of languages and designs. Sometimes, they turn into full projects.

# Skills
I am proficient in:
- Rust
- C#
- Python
- C++

Intermediate in:
- CUDA
- Dart/Flutter

and familiar with:
- Lua
- Java
- TypeScript
- Julia
- MySQL
- Kotlin

I have great logical and analytical skills and can figure out and solve problems when coding.\
I am empathetic, understanding, collaborative and fun to work with.\
I can tutor others and teach them how to improve on their skills in a non-condescending way.

# Goals
My goals are to learn and teach as much as possible, and to bring as much to the FOSS community as I can. Whether that be through contributions to large or small repositories or libraries/utilities I make/start myself, I hope to provide as much as possible. I also hope to one day be able to help secure systems at government level.

# Achievements
FRC 2022-2023: Our team won the Provincial Championship and was invited to the World Championships. I designed and created an app to streamline data entry to form better alliances. I also designed a much more developer-ergonomic, interface-based system for autonomous code, as opposed to autonomous based on switch statement sequences.

# Major Projects
I have many projects. These are projects that I've developed the furthest.
